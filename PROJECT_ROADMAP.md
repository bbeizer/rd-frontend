## **Current Logic Review**

- **Polling:**  
  - Only runs in multiplayer and only when `!isUserTurn`.
  - Calls `fetchGameData` every 3 seconds.

- **State Update:**  
  - `setGameState` only updates if the new state is different (`JSON.stringify(prevState) !== JSON.stringify(convertedGame)`).

- **Modal:**  
  - In the UI, the modal is shown whenever `!isUserTurn`.

---

## **Potential Flicker Causes**

1. **State Comparison:**  
   - Using `JSON.stringify` can still cause updates if any non-essential field (like a timestamp, move history, etc.) changes, even if the turn hasn't changed.
   - This can cause the UI to briefly hide and show the modal if the server returns slightly different data on each poll.

2. **Polling Interval:**  
   - If the server is slow to update, the client may briefly think it's their turn, then switch back, causing a flicker.

---

## **How to Fix**

### **1. Only Update UI When Turn Changes**
- Instead of comparing the whole state, compare just the `currentPlayerTurn` (and maybe `status`).
- Only update `setGameState` if the turn or status actually changes.

### **2. Modal Logic**
- Keep the modal strictly tied to `!isUserTurn`.

---

## **Proposed Code Change**

Update the polling logic in `useGameState`:

```js
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```

This will prevent unnecessary UI updates and modal flicker when only non-essential fields change.
